# Simple Personal Portfolio Example
 __This is just a demo website where I implemented what I just learned about css and a little of JavaScript.__
 
 \* *This is a responsive website that has a hamburger menu for smaller screens, which was made with css and a couple of JavaScript lines so when you click the menu it slides open nicely.*

 \* *It has a hero background which covers a height 90vh so it gives 10vh to the navbar.*

 \* *The Navbar has a fixed position so it shows on the top all the time.*

 \* *For the layout I used Flexbox which gives the site a smooth transition between diferent screen sizes.*
